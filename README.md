## Install

```console

$ librarian setup
```
The setup will ask you a few questions to configure Librarian on your system. You can just press return through out the process to choose the default values.

## Usage

### Starting Librarian

Run the following command to start the Librarian server.  

```console
$ librarian start
```
This will start the web interface, and will print the URL to it on the console, along with a QR code to the URL for quick access üòÅ

Librarian uses [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/product) tunneling to serve your localhost over the Internet using a secure `HTTPS` tunnel.

### Submitting Builds

Submit builds to Librarian using:

```console
$ librarian submit <pathToFile> [options]
```
The `pathToFile` must be te full path to the `IPA` or `APK` file. Example: `/Users/jenkins/MyApp.ipa`, and should be accessible by Librarian.

You can pass in the following additional options along with the path of the build file.

Option | Short | Example | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`--branch <branch>` | `-b` | `--branch master` | git branch the build is from
`--notes <notes>` | `-n` | `--notes "Release Candidate Build"` | release notes for the build
`--public` | `-p` | Just add the flag `--public` | allow the build to be downloaded over the HTTPs tunnel (by default, builds can only be downloaded on the local network)

Librarian will autodetect the type of build `iOS / Android` using the file extension, will create a copy of the build in it's assets, and make it available for download on it's web interface.
